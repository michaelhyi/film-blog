## About 

This repository contains the source code to a film blog I started last year. It is a platform where I can explore my passion for movies and write for fun. 

Though not my most "impressive" project, it's my favorite one to have worked on thus far. I have put several hundred commits into this project, all while experimenting with different technologies and learning along the way.

Source code has been moved here on October 25th, 2024. It was preivously part of my personal website's respository.
